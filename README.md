Overview:

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each type of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer.

Change will be provided using a combination of the largest bill and coin denominations as possible.

Denominations that are not used will not be displayed.
